The abstract and the introduction were set up nicely and I was quite intrigued to see a theoretical analysis and practical implementation of a neural network using analogue hardware. However, as I read through the paper carefully multiple times, I realized that the expository opening description fails to live up to the standard it sets. \n\nTo be more specific, I did not enjoy the elaborate description of noisy analogue conductances as the noise models analyzed in the paper are not tested on any of such devices. The noise model introduced is fairly simplistic and arguably, the real-world systems are much more complex compared to such simplistic assumptions. The authors could have presented the paper as an analysis of knowledge distillation in neural network training. Even if the paper were presented that way, I would have doubted its chance of acceptance due to the incrementality of the theoretical contribution.\n\nAll in all, I believe this is a very promising direction to invest, but the paper is not quite ready for ICLR.", "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_derivations_and_theory": "I assessed the sensibility of the derivations and theory."}
