The object classification task is not really relevant to elicit the observed behavior and 2. Inhibitory neurons are not essential (at least when training with batch norm). \n\nDo the conclusions of the paper about understanding of E/I cells in the brain still hold? I am not really sure. I would like to urge the authors to carefully assess their conclusions again in light of the new evidence and perhaps rephrase abstract, intro and discussion where necessary.\n\nHaving said that, I still like the paper and its approach. I think it provides valuable insights to the field (e.g. neuro-inspired architecture design, concerns regarding training objectives, etc.) and important steps in the right direction and could be a valuable contribution even if the original claims are not entirely substantiated.\n\n\n[Original review]\n\nThis paper seeks to understand why excitatory neurons in cortex are more stimulus selective than inhibitory cells and why excitatory cells are more sparsely connected to each other. The authors train a recurrent neural network model with a number of biological constraints on CIFAR-10. These constraints include Dale's law, an unequal number of E vs. I cells and only excitatory connections between layers (areas) of the network. I would summarize the main findings as follows:\n\n- Excitatory principal neurons are more selective and more sparsely connected to each other than local inhibitory neurons, consistent with biology\n\n- Stimulus selectivity and performance depend only on the number of excitatory cells, but neither on the E/I ratio nor the number of I cells\n\n- High selectivity appears to be a general property of principal cells, but does not depend on the sign of local connections, while sparse connectivity is mainly linked to the excitatory local connections\n\n\nStrengths:\n+ Architectural decisions are well motivated from a neuroscientific perspective\n+ Provides a hypothesis why certain connectivity and selectivity patterns emerge in the brain by incorporating biological knowledge into neural network models trained on a specific task\n+ Well written and clear, logic development of the arguments\n\nWeaknesses:\n- Unclear whether classification task is necessary to elicit the authors' observations\n- Interneurons seem unnecessary, raising concerns about relevance of results\n- Also trains on ImageNet, but only some results are shown; most from CIFAR\n\n\nOverall I like the paper from the perspective of a neuroscientist, as it provides a kind of normative account of why things in the brain might look the way they do. My enthusiasm is somewhat limited, however, because I am not convinced the classification task is actually what drives the authors' observations. I am willing to increase my score and argue more strongly for the paper if the authors can address this concern, detailed in the following:\n\nA few observations lead me to believe the classification task the networks are trained may not be important to elicit the observed behavior. \n\n1.) The emergent properties in stimulus selectivity show up almost immediately after training starts according to Fig. 5A+B. Performance, on the other hand, takes a few more epochs to pick up according to Fig. 10. \n\n2.) The connectivity preferences that emerge in Figure 5C appear at already 50 epochs where CIFAR-10 performance is at 50%. To put that into perspective, a linear SVM already achieves 40% on this task, and a one-layer multilayer perceptron with only 100 hidden neurons reaches that performance. \n\n3.) The results of Fig. 11 suggest that the number of inhibitory channels is not important. Did the authors try a stripped down version with only excitatory cells?\n\nI suggest the authors train on CIFAR-10 with shuffled labels on the training set [Zhang et al. 2016; https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.03530]. Although performance on the test set would be at chance (no object recognition capabilities), it would be interesting to see whether the selectivity and connectivity properties still emerge.\n\nFinally, (related to 3.) I wonder whether it makes sense to draw conclusions about differences between E and I cells from a model trained on a task where the number of inhibitory cells seems irrelevant. Wouldn't one need to have at least both types of neurons to be required for the task in order to draw such conclusions?\n\n\nMinor Comments:\n\n- I sometimes found the nomenclature of the multiple models you tried a bit confusing and hard to follow \u2014 especially in parts of the Appendix\n\n- The type of operations (convolution, element-wise) in equation 1, together with the meaning of nonlinearities like \\sigma_c are only defined one page after, making that section a bit hard to follow.
