The proposed method can be used to compile various deep network architectures. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the previous method with large margin.\n\nThe paper exploits reinforcement learning to address code compilation, which is novel for me. \n\nThe experimental results are convincing, the paper evaluates the proposed evaluation in multiple aspects.\n\nI am totally new in the area. I will refer to the other reviews' review and the authors' rebuttal to have my final decision.\n\n\nPost-rebuttal\nThank the other two reviewers and the authors to help me better understand the paper. I think I have no concern on the paper so I still give 6.", "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_derivations_and_theory": "I assessed the sensibility of the derivations and theory."}
