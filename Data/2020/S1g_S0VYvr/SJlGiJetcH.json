However, if we want to drastically reduce the sample complexity, we need longer planning horizons. Therefore, we should be looking further in this direction but this is out of scope for this paper.\n\nModel Learning:\n- Good idea to update the conclusion and treat the online model learning as future work.\n\nFigure 3:\nYou could plot axes a - f in a single row and remove the colorbar for each individual plot. Just do one colorbar for all plots. This would also improve the comparability of the different methods. Currently, the color-coding is different for each axis, which is bad practice. Axes g - i can be reshaped in a separate figure. Furthermore, figure 2 is not necessary as the 4 room environment is depicted in Fig. 3 a - f and and one could reference these axes. \n\n=> I keep my rating as weak accept.\n\n# Review:\nSummary:  \nThe paper proposes an adaptive scheme to adapt the horizon of the value function update. Therefore, the sample efficiency should be increased and the value function should be learned faster. \n\nConclusion: \nThe problem of learning good policies from partially correct models is very interesting and important. The proposed approach is technically sound and reasonable. The experiments highlight the qualitative as well as quantitative performance. Furthermore, the quantitative performance is compared to state-of-the-art methods. I cannot comment on the related work as I am not familiar with the baselines MVE & STEVE. \n\nMy Main Concerns are:\n\n- The roll-out horizon is 3-5 timesteps. This horizon is really short especially for problems with strong non-linearities and high sampling frequencies. For such systems 5 timesteps would only correspond to 0.5s (10Hz) or 0.05s (100Hz) and I am uncertain whether these short horizons really help for such problems. \n\n- The specialized online model learning algorithm seems quite hacky. It feels like it was introduced last minute to make it work. The overall question of how should we learn a model optimally is super important and should be addressed within a separate paper (and more thoroughly). I would even propose to remove the online learning section from this paper as it is just too hacky and without relation to prior work or context. \n\n- Could the authors please update figure 3 as the figure has too much whitespace. This whitespace could be used to enlarge the individual axis when the axis are rearranged.  \n", "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_derivations_and_theory": "I assessed the sensibility of the derivations and theory."}
