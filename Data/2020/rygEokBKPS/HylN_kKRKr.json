By comparing with Parsimonious and Bandits, the proposed approach achieves lower query complexity and higher attack success rate (ASR).\n\nI have two main concerns about the current version:\n\n1)  Some important baselines might be missing. In addition to (Ilyas et al., 2018b) and (Moon et al., 2019), the methods built on zeroth-order optimization (namely, gradient estimation via function differences) were not compared. Examples include \n[1] There are No Bit Parts for Sign Bits in Black-Box Attacks\n[2] AutoZOOM: Autoencoder-based Zeroth Order Optimization Method for Attacking Black-box Neural Networks\n[3] SIGNSGD VIA ZEROTH-ORDER ORACLE\n \n2) In addition to attack success rate and query complexity, it might be useful to compare different attacks in terms of $\\ell_p$ distortion, where $p \\neq \\infty$. This could provide a clearer picture on whether or not the query efficiency and the attack performance are at the cost of increasing the $\\ell_1$ and $\\ell_2$ distortion significantly.\n\n\n########### Post-feedback ##############\nThanks for the response and the additional experiments to address my first question.  However, I am not satisfied with the response \"But clearly our methods aim to reach the boundary of linf ball, so the distortion might be large\" to the second question.\n\nI am Okay with the design of $\\ell_\\infty$ attack. However, if the reduction in query complexity is at a large cost of perturbation power, e.g., measured by $\\ell_2$ norm, then it is better to demonstrate this tradeoff. Furthermore, if the $\\ell_2$ norm is constrained, will the proposed $\\ell_\\infty$ attack outperform the others? This is also not clear to me.\n\nThus, I decide to keep my score.
