FactorGANs are applied to the problem of semi-supervised (paired+unpaired) translation and demonstrate good performance.\n\nStrengths:\n-Nice formulation, which I believe is novel. Well written, good initial results.\n\nLimitations:\n-The most serious limitation of the paper is that the technique is not compared with any other semi-supervised methods, such as the Augmented CycleGAN. Because of this it is not clear how the technique compares with SOTA, and so the significance of the paper is not clear.\n-The approach scales linearly with the number of marginals, which may limit its applicability to more general imputation tasks.\n-The title is the same as an the arxiv paper title, and so the double-blind requirement is trivially violated.\n\nOverall:\n\nA nice formulation, but weak experimental investigations (no comparisons to SOTA semi-supervised translation) make the significance of the paper unclear. This makes it a borderline paper. I strongly encourage the authors to update their experiments accordingly.\n\nPost Response:\n\nThank you to the authors for the detailed response and additional experimentation. I have updated my rating. It is a nice formulation, and the experimental validation of the technique has been strengthened. The additional experiments (i.e. comparing to the augmented cyclegan) that the authors are following through on will further improve the paper, making it a clear accept.\n", "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_derivations_and_theory": "I assessed the sensibility of the derivations and theory."}
