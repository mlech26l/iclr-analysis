The mathematical notations are also inconsistent throughout different places in the paper.\n\nThe extensive literature of modelling time series with seasonality trends, both in the statistics and the machine learning community, is severely under-represented in the motivations and related works. Models like SARIMA have no mention in the paper. \n\nThe temporal regularization imposed in section 3.2, coupled with an autoencoder, does not seem very different from the state-space models and their more complex and recent variants that use multi-layered networks (a google search will provide plenty references).  \n\nThe experiments, with many of the useful baselines missing, are equally unimpressive.
