Both models are based on LSTM architectures. Unfortunately there is no clear description of these models, which makes it difficult to understand their structure.\n\nThe experimental section contains a questionable selection on the train/test split (which should have been done blindly before looking at the results) and lacks any baseline comparison with previous approaches. The authors argue that performing arc prediction and arc labeling in two separate stages is beneficial, but they don't compare with a method that perform both actions at the same time.\n\nThe motivation of the paper is also questionable: the introduction section describes some of the peculiarities of the Amharic language, such as being morphologically rich, but the proposed method seems completely generic and does not address or exploits any of these peculiarities. If the authors want to argue that Amharic would benefit from specialized parser architecture, the methods and results reported in this paper fail to provide evidence for this position.\n\nThe citation format is also broken.\n", "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_derivations_and_theory": "N/A"}
