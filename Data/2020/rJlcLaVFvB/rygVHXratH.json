The SDPC model is compared with HILA on 2 different databases, and the experimental results show that SDPC achieved lower prediction error, faster converge rate. \n\nAlthough the paper is well-motivated and well-written, the potential impact of this work is limited in the community. Moreover, the experiments are not sufficient to valid the advantage of this model. For example, there are only 3 dataset adopted in the experiments and the all these three datasets are quite small. Moreover, there is only one baseline, which seems too weak to show the advantage of the model.\n\nBased on the above points, I tend to reject the paper.\n\n**updated comments**\nThanks for the response and I really appreciate the hard work during the rebuttal. However, the STL-10 is still a small scale dataset, and the baselines provided in the rebuttal are still limited. I will not change the original score.", "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_derivations_and_theory": "I assessed the sensibility of the derivations and theory."}
