The authors argue that while most of the earlier work consider these to be different, they are actually the same and give theory and empirical results to back up this claim.\n\nThis is not an easy paper to read, as the authors immediately jump into heavy notation without much intuition or visual aid. It would be much better to include some figures to help the readers appreciate the work.\nThis continues throughout the experiments as well, where the authors are not very gentle when it comes to presentation.\n\nI gave a weak accept as I do not want my (unfortunately) weak review (due to the paper topic not being my strong point) to have a great effect on the final decision. However, it is clear that the paper can and should be better written, and the paper ideas made closer to the readers. At the moment this is definitely not the case.\n\n\n======= AFTER THE REBUTTAL ===========\n\nThank you for working on making the paper more accessible. I am perfectly fine with seeing this paper at the conference, and will change the vote to Accept simply to not block on my vote and to ensure the SPC makes sure to thoroughly consider this paper (in case they do some sort of ranking of paper reviews for deciding who gets accepted). However please note that my confidence remains as low as previously.\nIt is unfortunate that ICLR did not do any paper-reviewer matching like other conferences and that you are stuck with my weak review. But that is a different story that the organizers should make sure to address asap.", "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_derivations_and_theory": "I did not assess the derivations or theory."}
