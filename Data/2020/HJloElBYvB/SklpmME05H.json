Based on the theory developed in the paper, an algorithm is developed to find phase transition points. The interesting observation is phase transition can correspond to learning new class and this paper conjectures in IB for classification, the number of phase transitions is at most C-1, C the number of classes.  This observation deserves to be further explored and may be a key to a deeper understanding of neural networks. \n\nThe theory developed connects the IB objective, dataset and the representation, and thorough proofs are given.  The experiments matches the theoretical findings. \n", "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_derivations_and_theory": "I did not assess the derivations or theory."}
