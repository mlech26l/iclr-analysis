The proposed model is built on a hierarchical mixture model: one component for generating foreground and the other one for generating the background, while the model for generating background is also a mixture model. The model is trained by standard ELBO with Gumbel-Softmax relaxation of the binary latent variable. To avoid the bounding box separation, the authors propose the boundary loss, which will be combined with the ELBO for training. The authors evaluated the proposed on 3D-room dataset and Atari. \n\n\nThere are several issues need to be addressed:\n\n\n1, The organization of the paper should be improved. For example, the introduction to the generative model is too succinct: the spatial attention model did not be introduced in main text. Why this model is call 'spatial attention' is not clear to me. The boundary loss seems an important component, however, it is never explicitly presented. \n\n2, The parallel inference is due the mean-field approximation, in which the posterior is approximated with factorized model, therefore, the flexibility is restricted. This is a trade-off between flexibility and parallel inference. The drawback of such parametrization should be explicitly discussed. I was wondering is there any negative effect of such the approximated posterior with fully factorized model comparing to the SPAIR?\n\n3, The empirical evaluation is not convincing. The quality illustration in Fig.1, 2 and 3 uses different examples for different methods. This cannot demonstrate the advantages of the proposed model. The quantitative evaluation only shows one baseline, SPAIR, in Table 1, and other baselines (IODINE and GENESIS) are missing. With such empirical results, the performances of the proposed method are not convincing. \n\nIn sum, I think this paper is not ready to be published. \n\n====================================================================\n\nI have read the authors' reply and the updated version. I will raise my score to 6. \n\nAlthough the mean-field inference is standard, the model in the paper looks still interesting and the performances are promising. \n\nI expect the boundary loss should be specified formally in the final version.", "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_derivations_and_theory": "I assessed the sensibility of the derivations and theory."}
