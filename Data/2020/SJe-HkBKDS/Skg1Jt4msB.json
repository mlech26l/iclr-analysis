The paper also doesn't adhere to the conference paper template, which is grounds for desk rejection.\n\nThe authors should revise the paper with this information and consider submitting to a different venue, as the task considered, while interesting, seems far from the core focus of ICLR.\n", "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_derivations_and_theory": "N/A"}
