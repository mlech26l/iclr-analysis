The entire paper lacks focus and I suggest authors consider focusing on 1-2 well thought-out ideas. There are many 3-4 line long sentences that are hard to decipher. Please also consider making the presentation more accessible.\n\nOverall, this paper does not meet the bar for ICLR.", "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_derivations_and_theory": "I assessed the sensibility of the derivations and theory."}
