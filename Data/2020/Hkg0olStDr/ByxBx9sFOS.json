The paper builds a decentralized algorithm based on previous domain adaptation methods.\n\nPros: \n1. The problem is novel and practical. Previous domain adaptation assumes that source and target domains are available but it can happen when the source and target domains have connection issues.\n2. The method exploits asynchronizing accumulating and synchronizing update, which reduces the cost of communication between domains.\n3. The paper proposes to use Wasserstein distance to select the optimal domain as the source domain for the target domain. \n4. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms baselines.\n\nCons:\n1. The asynchronizing accumulating and synchronizing update is not novel. It has been used in other communities such as reinforcement learning.\n\nOverall, the paper is good and it is technically sound. The contribution is not significant to the community but providing a new perspective for domain adaptation. I vote for weak accept.\n\nThank Reviewer1 for reminding. I think the paper still has some novelty and the comments address my concerns. I do  not change my score. Also, I'm not unhappy if the paper is rejected. It is more like a borderline paper.", "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_derivations_and_theory": "I carefully checked the derivations and theory."}
