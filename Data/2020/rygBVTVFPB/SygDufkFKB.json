Their opinion and the rebuttal did not convince me to update my score. In my opinion the writing must be adapted to be interesting to the ICLR community and the bigger picture should be highlighted more, as the bigger picture is remains quite unclear at the current state.\n\n\n##### Review:\nSummary: \n[...]\n\n\nConclusion:\nI have read the paper multiple times and I still have a problem summarizing the paper with my own words. The contributions summarize the most fundamental works of RL but do not really relate these methods to the proposed approach. Therefore, I am still uncertain about the general motivation and intention of the work as well as the evaluation. Currently I vote for borderline reject as I am familiar with RL & PDE'S but do not understand the motivation and intention. I am leaning towards rejection as the paper is a resubmission from Neurips and has not been substantially improved. However, I am not certain about my evaluation. I am happy to adapt my vote based on the other reviewers and a clarified and better structured paper, which can be submitted during the rebuttal.", "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_derivations_and_theory": "N/A"}
