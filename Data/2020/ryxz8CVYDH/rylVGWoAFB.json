The approach is novel since L2L provides a new perspective to zeroth-order optimization. \n\nHowever, I have some concerns about the current version. \n\n1) The knowledge that one should use to train UpdateRNN and  QueryRNN is not clear. A clear presentation is required \n\n2) Please clarify the optimization variables in (4). In general, the problem is not clearly defined. \n\n3) Eq. 5 is a query-expensive gradient estimate. Will it make training extremely expensive?\n\n4) The computation and query complexity are unclear during training and testing.\n\n5) Pros and cons of L2L? It seems that training a L2L network is not easy. Does its advantage exist only when inference? A better discussion should be made.\n\n########## post-feedback #######\nThanks for the response. In the pros of L2L, the authors mentioned \"The learned optimizer is trained on a small subset of optimization problems and apply in a wide range of problems in similar classes.\" In the setting of attack generation, does it mean that there exists an attack transferbility from a small group of training images to a large group of testing images? Is the transferbility a requirement for applying L2L in design of attacks. Please try to make these points clearer in the revised version. I keep my decision 'weak accept'.
