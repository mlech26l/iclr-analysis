The authors show that in the \u201clazy training\u201d regime both over- and under-parametrized approximators converge exponentially fast, the former to the global minimum of the projected TD error and the latter to a local minimizer of the same error surface. Simply put, the lazy regime refers to the approximator behaving as if it had been linearized around its initialization point. This can happen if the approximation is rescaled, but can also occur as a side-effect of its initialization. The authors present simple numerical examples illustrating their claims.\n\nAlthough I did not carefully check the math, this seems like a solid contribution on the technical side. My main concern about the paper is that it falls short in providing intuition and contextualizing its technical content. Regarding the presentation, I believe it is possible to have a less dry prose without sacrificing mathematical rigor. If some of the technical material is moved to the appendix --like auxiliary results, discussion on proof techniques, etc--, the additional space could be used to discuss the implications of the theoretical results in more accessible terms.\n\nFor example, a subject that ought to be discussed more clearly is the nature of the approximation induced by the lazy training regime. As far as I understand, this regime can be thought of as a sort of regularization that severely limits the capacity of the approximator.  Although the authors mention in the conclusion that \u201c...convergence of lazy models may come at the expense of their expressivity\u201d, after reading the paper I do not have a clear sense of how expressive such models actually are. In their experiments, Chizat et al. (2018) observed that the performance of commonly used neural networks degrades when trained in the lazy regime --to a point that they consider it unlikely that the successes of deep learning can be credited to this regime of training. It seems to me that this subject should be more explicitly discussed in a paper that sets out to provide theoretical support for deep reinforcement learning.\n\nStill regarding the behavior of lazy approximators, my intuitive understanding is that they work as a linear model using random features. If this interpretation is correct, this makes the theoretical results a bit less surprising. They are still interesting, though, for they can be seen as relying on a \u201csmoother\u201d version of the linearity assumption often made in the related literature. Maybe this is also something worth discussing? Still on this subject, it seems to me that one potential disadvantage of lazy models with respect to their linear counterparts is that it is less clear how to enforce the lazy regime in practice. In Section 4.2 the authors discuss how this can naturally happen as a side-effect of the initialization, but it is unclear how applicable the particular strategy used to illustrate this phenomenon, with the \u201cdoubling trick\u201d, is in practice. This is another example of a less technical discussion that would make the paper a stronger contribution.", "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_derivations_and_theory": "I did not assess the derivations or theory."}
