The additional term favors the preservation on information in a mapping from an input edge feature vector e_{i,j} to a weight matrix f(e_{i,j}) used in computing messages across the edge from node i to node j.  A variational lower bound on the mutual information is used in training.  Impressive empirical results are given for chemical property prediction and relation prediction in knowledge graphs.  I have no real complaints other than I might recommend citing the original work on infomax:\n\n\"Self Organization in a Perceptual Network\", Ralph Linsker, 1988.\n\nPostscript:  I have been swayed by the complaints of reviewer 1 and reduced my score to weak reject.", "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_derivations_and_theory": "I carefully checked the derivations and theory."}
