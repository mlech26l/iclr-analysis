Authors provide an interesting and possible limitation of TCAV during rebuttal (in the XOR case TCAV might not be able to identify meaningful subspace). It would strengthen the paper by somehow proving it. Maybe you can visualize the TCAV vectors and your vectors in the simulation and use it to explain why TCAV selects unrelevant concept 11, or designs another simple experiments. \nAlso, if accepted, please consider more parameter stability analysis in the real datasets, including ablation studies of different regularizations. This helps readers understand the value of this method in the real data.\n\nOverall I like the paper much better after rebuttal, but still have a lukewarm feeling about it. I do not see lots of value in the current method, probably due to not very interesting or interpretable results in the real data. However, it does provide a new concept of completeness, and I agree with R1 that it's interesting and relevant. So I would change my rating to weak accept.\n\n====================================================================================================\nOriginal evaluation:\n\nThis paper can be seen as an extension to the paper Ghorbani et al., 2019 to try to extract \"complete\" unsupervised concepts as well as maintainting interpretability. Compared to Ghorbani et al., they have 2 modifications. First, they try to learn a set of concept vectors such that the resulting projected activations on this concept basis would not lose too much accuracy, which they call completeness. Second, to maintain interpretability for these vectors, they regularize these vectors to sparsely match to some input clusters (generated by the k-means) that human can examine, and regularize no two concept matches to the same cluster. They validate their concepts in the simulation, text and image datasets.\n\nOverall I feel the idea is interesting but a bit straightforward. The resulting concept vectors are also not very interpretable or interesting in the text and image domain, which seems to limit its utility to practioners. \n\nAlso, one of the problem is how to select the coefficients for the regularization. In the supplements authors mention that they choose lambda=10 and it produces \"reasonable\" results in the simulation. This decreases the credibility of the simulation that shows it outperforms the baselines such as TCAV, as it sounds like you set the parameters to get good metrics on this simulation. Moreover, in the real-world data there might not be an easy way to set these parameters. I think the authors could strengthen the paper by experimenting with different coefficients and examine the stability of the resulting explanations, or at least indicate how results differ if the coefficients are set differently. Or do an ablation study about how different objectives shape the resulting concepts.\n\nBesides, I will suggest to plot a figure to show number of concepts used v.s. the completeness score. It will motivate why choosing specific number of concepts in the experiements. Also experimenting with different number of concepts is helpful for readers to see the stability of this method as well. \n\nSome minor questions:\n1. The claim of the result of the image dataset says it focuses on the texture. I think it might be caused by the super-pixel segmentation, which already removes most of the edges and leaves with the texture clusters. \n2. Any intuition of why TCAV performs worse in the simulation? How do you select the top 5 vectors for the TCAV, and why does it select non-useful concept 11?\n3. In the definition saliency score (page 4), I am just wondering if the normalized vector could be better? So the resulting value would not be affected by different magnitude of u_k or concept vectors c_j.\n4. In the definition of the conceptSHAP score, shouldn't it be the average of conceptSHAP score across all the classes instead of the sum (inline equation near eq. 6)? If you have 1000 class, then the conceptSHAP score could be something around 1000, that will be wierd.\n\nWriting:\n- I am confused at first read in the 2nd paragraph of the section 3 in page 4. The word \"concept\" is overloaded and represent both as input concept clusters and the resulting concept vectors. Such as \"...candidate clusters of concepts...\" or \"... each concept is salient to one cluster ...\".\n- Typo: \"They main takeaway\" -> \"The main takeaway\"\n\nStrengths:\n+ Good related work\n+ Somewhat complete evaluation\nWeaknesses:\n- No analysis with so many hyparparameters (reg lambda, number of concepts), and thus not sure about the validity of the simulation\n- Idea is interesting but straightforward\n- Not very interpretable results", "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_derivations_and_theory": "I assessed the sensibility of the derivations and theory."}
