Especially, the authors show that for appropriate initialization, SMO converges to a global minimum with a minimal distance to the initialization. The authors also report some experimental results to verify this theory.\n\nThe implicit regularization of SGD/SMD is widely studied in the literature. Although it is claimed that the paper improved existing results by either considering nonlinear models or identify more precise implication regularization, the contribution is a bit minor. In particular, the fundamental identity in Lemma 6 is exactly a specific case of Lemma 4 in  Azizan & Hassibi (2018) with no noises. Moreover, Azizan & Hassibi (2018) also discussed the implicit regularization of SMD in their Theorem 10 for nonlinear models with some localization arguments. This paper considers similar localization arguments with some different assumptions.\n\nAfter rebuttal:\nI am sorry to select by mistake a N/A for the correctness of experiments.  \nI have read the authors' rebuttal and would not like to change my score. The fundamental identity in Lemma 6 was already derived in Azizan & Hassibi (2018). This paper identifies some assumptions to show the implicit regularization studied in Azizan & Hassibi (2018) with heuristic argument. However, these assumptions are very strong and with the assumptions the argument follows similarly to those in Azizan & Hassibi (2018). Indeed, as stated in Azizan & Hassibi (2018), the convergence in linear case depends on the non-negativity of $D_{L_i}(w,w_{i-1})$. In this paper, the authors just assume that this non-negativity holds locally in Assumption 1. In my opinion, this seems not a rigorous way to formulate assumptions.", "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_derivations_and_theory": "I assessed the sensibility of the derivations and theory."}
