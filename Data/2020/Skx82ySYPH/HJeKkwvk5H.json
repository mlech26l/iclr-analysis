{"experience_assessment": "I have read many papers in this area.", "rating": "6: Weak Accept", "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_experiments": "I assessed the sensibility of the experiments.", "review_assessment:_thoroughness_in_paper_reading": "I read the paper thoroughly.", "title": "Official Blind Review #2", "review": "The following work proposes several improvements over prior works in unsupervised/self-supervised keypoint-descriptor learning such as Christiansen et al. One improvement is the relaxation of the cell-boundaries for keypoint prediction -- specifically allowing keypoints anchored at the cell's center to be offset into neighboring cells. Another change was the introduction of an inlier-outlier classifier network to be used as a proxy loss for the keypoint position and descriptors. They found the inlier-outlier loss to improve homography accuracy at 1 and 3 pixel thresholds.\n\nStrengths:\n-The ablation study seems complete\n-Clear improvements over state of the art methods\n\nWeaknesses/improvements:\n-The description of the evaluation procedure was a bit vague. Is RANSAC being used to find correspondences? If so, perhaps error bars are necessary to account for variance across multiple runs?\n-Make it more clear in the related works about how the proposed method relates to Unsuperpoint. My understanding is that the proposed work is a somewhat incremental improvement over Unsuperpoint.\n-Section 3.3 (Score learning) was a bit difficult to follow. I find it better to start by stating the high level goal of the loss function before going into the formulation.\n-Captions for Tables 2 and 3 are lacking. At the very least, mention what the numbers being compared are.\n\nOverall, I think the improvements are a bit incremental, but the experiments seem to support the claim that they are beneficial. I had some concerns about the clarity of the paper, and would be willing to raise my rating if addressed.\n\nPost Rebuttal:\nThe authors have adequately addressed my concerns regarding clarity. I have updated my rating to weak accept in agreement with the other reviews.", "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_derivations_and_theory": "N/A"}
