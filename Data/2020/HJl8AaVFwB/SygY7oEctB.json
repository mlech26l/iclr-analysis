The combine 2 existing approaches for taxonomic classification, with established methods for Multiple Instance Learning, namely DeepSets and an attention-based pooling layer. \n\nWhile the domain of taxonomic classification is interesting, I find there is a lack of novelty on the machine learning part. The authors combine well established methods in a straight-forward manner and while the resulting increase in performance for some datasets may be relevant in the domain, the conceptual advances are too incremental for a machine learning audience. \n\nUpdate: I have read the response and am still think there is a lack of novelty here.
