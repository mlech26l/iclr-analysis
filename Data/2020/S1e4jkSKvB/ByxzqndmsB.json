This is quite an important problem to study as this helps to develop better understanding of the current architectures and potentially reduce their size without suffering the accuracy drop. This is a great theoretical contribution.\n\nThe paper studies this per module compared to previous works where the entire architecture is rewounded. The paper also studies this for ResNet models which are more widely/practically used than just the fully connected layers alone. This helps better understand the model as a whole. \n\nThe authors do a good robust experimental study for different network initialization, various CNN models like ResNet18, 34, 101, VGG16 and also FCN. The results demonstrate the module criticality to be a good metric for generalization of models.\n\nOverall, a good paper.", "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_derivations_and_theory": "I did not assess the derivations or theory."}
