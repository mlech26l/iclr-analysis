The authors first propose a new score for pruning called E[BN]. Then, the authors observe the generalization error and the test accuracy mean/variance for pruning large score weights and small score weights for VGG11, ResNet18, and Conv4 models. From these experiments, the authors observe that pruning large score weights generates instable but high test accuracy and smaller generalization gap compared to pruning small score weights. The authors additionally study some other aspects of pruning (e.g., pruning as a noise injection) and conclude the paper.\n\nOverall, I am not sure whether the observation holds in general due to the below reasons. \n\n- The authors proposed a new score E[BN] and all experiments are performed on this. However, how it differs from the usual magnitude-based pruning in practice is unclear. I would like to know whether similar behavior is observed for the na\u00efve magnitude-based pruning.\n\n- I think that the author\u2019s observation is quite restricted and cannot extend to a general statement since the experiments are only done for pruning small score/large score weights. To verify the generalization and instability trade-off, I believe that it is necessary to examine several (artificial) pruning methods controlling the instability of test accuracies and check whether the proposed trade-off holds. For example, one can design pruning methods that disconnect (or almost disconnect) the network connection from the bottom to the top (i.e., pruned network always outputs constant) with some probability to extremely increase the instability.\n\n- The authors did not report the results for high sparsity.\n\nBesides, I am not sure the meaning of the instability since when the test accuracy of the pruned model is higher than that of the unpruned model, the instability could be large.\n\nOther comments:\n- The first paragraph mentions that the generalization gap might be a function of the number of parameters. However, I think that it is quite trivial that the generalization gap is not a function of the number of parameters while it only provides the upper bound.\n----------------------------------------------------------\nI have read the authors' response. Thanks for clarifying the definition of instability and additional experiments with high sparsity. However, I will maintain my score due to the following concern. \n\nThe remaining concern is that the current evidence for verifying generalization-stability tradeoff is not convincing as the authors presented only some examples having small and large instability (e.g., pruning smallest/largest weights) under the same pruning algorithm. I think that the results would be more convincing if the authors add a test accuracy plots given a fixed prune ratio, whose x-axis is controlled instabilities (e.g., from 10% to 90%) among various pruning algorithms (other than magnitude-based ones, e.g., Hessian based methods). It would be much more interesting if the same instability results same test accuracy even for different pruning algorithms.\n", "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_derivations_and_theory": "N/A"}
