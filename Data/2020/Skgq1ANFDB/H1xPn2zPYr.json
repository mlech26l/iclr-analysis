The proposed techniques are theoretically formulated and empirically justified. The authors showed that, when the curvature (Hessian) of the network is bounded, improved certificate can be achieved by convex optimization. Explicit curvature regularization via CRT seems further improve both the certified robustness accuracy and the certificate, at a cost of 2% decrease in empirical robust accuracy. \n\nWhile the proposed approaches are theoretically sound, I have several concerns, mostly on the experiments.\n=================\n1. Existing certification methods should be compared in more details, in terms of different assumptions, activation functions, etc. A summary table can help.\n\n2. Comprehensive comparisons to more existing works such as \"Certified adversarial robustness via randomized smoothing\" (more formal comparison than in the appendix). \n\n3. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and different activation functions in the main text.\n\n4. Not sure why compare to uncertified defenses PGD and TRADES, though it doesn't seem to hurt the conclusions.\n\n===============\nAfter rebuttal:\n\nThanks for the response, my concerns have been addressed, rating upgraded to 6: weak accept.", "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_derivations_and_theory": "I assessed the sensibility of the derivations and theory."}
