These effects are observed after the break-even point. The further verified these predictions on BN networks.\n\nComments:\n\nUnderstanding the optimization trajectory is an important topic and this work is one step towards better understanding. There are many questions I hope the authors could clarify: \n\n- the concept of break even point, which justify whether the minima is stable or not, is also presented in Wu et al, 2018, including the proof. In the introduction of equation 1, the break even point concept seems to be novel in the context of learning trajectory. What is the difference with Wu et al, 2018? Does this break even point appear only once during training?\n\n- What is the practical usage for identifying the break-even point or stable/unstable of the optimizer? Does reaching the unstable phase of SGD earlier by large learning rate/small batch size mean better performance?\n\n- It seems the author does not apply learning rate decay for all experiments. What is the connection with learning rate decay? As we often see the training loss and validation error decreases significantly during training in step based learning rate schedule, what is their corresponding change of \\lambda_H^1 and \\lambda_K^1?\n\n- The authors did not mention whether momentum is used or not during training, which is commonly used in training neural nets. How would momentum affect the conjectures?\n\n- Regarding to conjecture 1 which states that \u201clarger\u201d learning rate yields lower \\lamda_H^1 and \\lamda_K^1, is there a limit for the range of learning rate? If we use learning rate 10, the training may not even converge. The experiments only verifies three learning rate with a maximum value 0.1, which does not cover \u201clarge\u201d learning rate.\n\n- Also as small batch size naturally results in more iterations than large batch given the same number of epochs. Comparing small batch and large batch may need to take this into account. By reaching the break-even-point \u201cearly\u201d, does it mean less number of epochs? I would like to see the comparison in terms of iterations rather than epochs. \n\n- In section 4.1, the definition of \\alpha* is not clear. It was noted in Figure 2 as the width of the loss surface and is defined to be the minimum step size along the adjacent iterate direction to have 20% loss increase. What is the unit of t here, is it a batch or epoch?\nHow exactly is \\alpha calculated? Due to the scale invariance [1,2], this \\alpha is not necessarily the true `width` of the loss surface as it could be influenced by the weight norm.\nWhy do different learning rates reach a similar \\alpha? It would be better to mark the starting point of the trajectory and the ending point of trajectory.\n\n- The illustration of Figure 1a is very unclearer. What is the x-axis and y-axis? Where is exactly the break-even point? It would be helpful to mark the starting and ending point of the trajectory. Also it would be helpful to have the values marked in the contours or make a separate value bar.\n\n\n- The authors studied whether the conjectures hold for BN networks in section 4.3. They only verified learning rate but not batch size. Does the batch size part still hold? It is known that BN requires larger batch size to work well, which may contradict with the conjecture that smaller batch size works better.\n\n\nMinor:\n- I was confused by the Figure 3 where different hyperparameters has different values at epoch 0. Does epoch 0 means the first epoch? It would be clear to have the same starting point and make epoch 0 as the initialization point.  \n\n- The experiments of DenseNet on ImageNet seems incomplete as it is only trained for 10 epochs. What is the top-1 error on the validation set?\n\n[1] https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.04933 \n[2] https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.09913\n\n\n-----update after rebuttal----------\n\nAfter reading the response, I think most of my questions are properly answered and corresponding changes are made in the revision. I  changed my score to weak accept. I would hope the authors could further improve the paper by well organizing the additional experiments and findings. Too much experiment variation settings make the paper not easy to follow. I hope the authors could make it clear about the practical benefits of identifying the existence of break even point with common experiments settings, e.g., nonzero momentum, weight decay and step based learning rate decay. In the new provided experiments about learning rate decay, I did not see the normal abrupt change of validation accuracy. More analysis about whether learning rate decay helps reaching break-even point would be great.
