The author provides supporting evidence for the structure of the early winning tickets: 1) lottery tickets emerge when the weight magnitude of a model saturates with SGD optimization. 2) pruning before model saturation may result in accuracy degradation. In the experiment part, they employ the memorization capacity analysis and discover the early wining tickets without expensive iterative pruning. The author also conducts extensive experiments with various ResNet architectures on both CIFAR 10 and ImageNet, achieving state-of-the-art results with only 1/5 of the total epochs for iterative pruning.\n\nStrength Bullets:\n\n1. The experiment organization is complete and convincing. Especially for the figure, it not only clearly shows that lottery tickets emerge much earlier before full training ends, but also shows the effect of rewinding. \n2. The author not reveal interesting observations, but also provides useful guidance. It is a complete logic chain that is also aligned with my intuition. For example, first, the author discusses the memorization capacity of different pruned models at different epochs. Then, they introduce a reasonable gradual pruning technique. Finally, they conduct experiments to confirm it.\n3.  The early winning tickets in this paper achieve state-of-the-art results with only 1/5 of the total epochs for iterative pruning.\n\nWeakness Bullets:\n\n1. For lottery tickets, especially for early winning tickets, I think there is a lot of randomnesses. Thus, for the plot like figure 2, figure 5, they need to contain an error bar and the curve should be the average of tens of experiments. It will be more convincing if it decouples the randomness from the real patterns.\n2. The description and organization of section 4 need to be more clear. For example, an algorithm pseudo code will definitely give readers a much more clear understanding of the early winning tickets finding strategy.\n\n\n\nQuestion the authors don't answer which confuses me more:\nNeed more convincing analysis about the indicator - Hamming Distance \n\nJust as the comment I posted after Review 1, we would like to see more analysis about Hamming Distance between different winning tickets. The author mentioned in the following way:\n\n''However, as we demonstrate in Fig. 3 of our paper, the mask-distance does not well characterize the winning tickets. E.g., the lottery tickets drawn at Epoch 120 and 200 have a mask distance of 0.082 in Fig. 3, which is much larger than the mask distance between Epoch 180 and 200. Whereas, all three tickets achieve comparably high accuracy as shown in Fig. 1, implying a shallow correlation between the accuracy and the mask distance''\n\nAs far as I know, this observation only tells us that the structure of the lottery tickets changes, which are drawn from 120 epochs to 180 epochs (although the maintain a similar accuracy). However, we can not conclude that the mask distance is not a reliable measure. As mention by the [EB] paper provided by the authors, you can use the rate of the distance change to indicate the early winning tickets. In this way, we can find winning tickets much earlier than authors' work.\n\nTo better address this question, I suppose the authors need to provide more analysis of the mask distance indicator. I think all three reviewers would like to see the results. A good indicator for early winning tickets is very important, otherwise authors' notion of early still involves quite a lot of training.\n\nRecommendation:\n\nDue to the unsolved important question, here is a weak reject.", "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_derivations_and_theory": "I carefully checked the derivations and theory."}
