Overall it is a solid and well-written article.\u00a0\n2. The interesting and novel part is the theoretical demonstration that a fixed number of neighbors can approximate well some algorithms in the literature (it approximates well w.r.t to the forward embedding produced by those algorithms and to the backward gradients in relation to the parameters),\u00a0\n3.It also demonstrates that some algorithms are impossible to approximate in constant time.\n\nWeaknesses:\n\n1. They do not introduce a new method, the algorithm is message-passing in which not all the neighbors are considered - authors choose a fixed number of neighbors by sampling. This gives them constant time for the calculation of the embedding w.r.t to the number of neighbors\n\nMain points:\n\nOverall, the article is well supported theoretically and quite complete. They generally show that if the assumptions made are contradicted, the approximation becomes impossible.\n\nThe experiments seem quite well chosen for the cases studied. In general, the experiments in which authors want to show the impossibility of an approximation, are done exactly on the corner cases chosen for the theoretical demonstrations. However,\u00a0 they also have experiments on real datasets, used in the literature.\n\nOther observations:\n\nIt is not very clear what do they mean by \"standardization layer from GCN\" which intervenes in several theorems.\n\nIt may have been good to show how accuracy varies relative to the chosen error. It is not very intuitive what an embedding approximation error of e = 0.01 means. For example, to have 0.1 error and 95% confidence I would have to choose 300 neighbors.... That seems to be a very large number, how practical is that?\n", "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_derivations_and_theory": "I assessed the sensibility of the derivations and theory."}
