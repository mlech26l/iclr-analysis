The proposed algorithm does not need to know the behavior policy probabilities, which provide a broader application scenario compared with previous work. It is based on directly solving the fixed point problem of the resulting target stationary distribution, instead of solving a fixed point problem about the stationary ratios.\n\nIn general, this paper is looking at an interesting problem with a lot of increasing focus these days. I think this paper contributes great idea and good theoretical analysis. I like the idea of matching the resulting target distribution instead of minimizing a loss over the ratio. However, several unclear places in the current version hurt the presentation of results. I would like to see them get improved and will increase my score accordingly if so.\n\nDetailed comments:\n\n1) The algorithm part could be presented more clearly. So far I did not see where the empirical operator \\hat{B} is formally defined. The word *empirical* is also confusing to me in \"B is approximated by empirical data\" because B is not an expectation, but an *integral* which has no *empirical* opposite of it. For the equations on top of page 5, shouldn't they be k[, ] about empirical operator instead of the expected operator since the RHS is already in sample-based form?\n\n2) Related with the last one, B has an integral. To approximate the integral, we only have one sample from the transition probability actually, and the sample state is not uniformly distributed. It needs some explanation of why that would not cause a problem to approximate the integral.\n\n3) The current loss function is invariant to the scale of w at all. Since the w is normalized, this is not a problem for the resulting estimator, ideally. However, that can be a numerical issue for float numbers. It's possible that the output from function approximator w goes to 0 or \\infty. Both cases can lead to NaN of the output/function approximator update eventually. I'd like to hear if the author has met this problem in the experiment or not, and how can that be fixed. \n\n4) I have to point out, as just a slight con of this paper, the technique used in this paper is not that much different from Liu et al 2018. Since it minimizes a loss function which is a supremum over an RKHS, and the resulting empirical loss also has a similar form. It's nice to see the author provide some details of making it work with mini-batch. These details are important for function approximator as NN.\n\nMinor point:\n - On page 12 the equations after \"We have by the definition of D_k\", I did not follow the second step of the equations.\n\nSuggestion:\nThis paper study the similar settings (behavior-agnostic OPE), using similar method (on the stationary distribution) came out several months ago: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.04733.pdf. I knew it's unfair to ask the author to compare it with a very recent prior/parallel work. However since they are in such a similar case, and they have code available, is it possible to directly compare with the result from their code? https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/dual_dice\n\n\n======= After rebuttal =======\nThe author's feedback clarified some of my concerns in the initial review. After reading the author's feedback and other reviews, I think this paper has enough show contribution to the related work. Some of my previous concerns (point 2 and 3) seems true for many related works in this area in general. I partly agree that it is not very fair to ask this paper to fix them. The updated version also presents the theory section in a more clear way. So I'd like to raise my score. I've no problem with acceptance, but I won't fully heart argue for acceptance.\n\n\n", "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_derivations_and_theory": "I carefully checked the derivations and theory."}
