I like the intuition of the paper but there are several weaknesses: \n\n1. The main concern is that the proposed method cannot outperform quantization-aware fine-tuning. This probably limits the application of the method --- it will only be used when there's not enough time budget for quantization-aware fine tuning for each specific choice of #bits. It will be good if the authors can discuss in what practical scenario their algorithm can be applied. \n\n2. The method is only tested under uniform symmetric quantization. I believe to demonstrate that the L1 regularized models are indeed easier to be quantized, we need to test it on several different kinds of quantizations. \n\n3. I have concerns about the hyper-parameter selection for lambda. The authors mentioned that lambda is chosen by grid-search, but what's the grid search criteria? In other words, are the hyper-parameters trying to minimize the validation error of the \"unquantized model\", or they are minimizing the validation error of the \"post-quantized model\"? \n\n4. Some minor suggestions: \n\n- The current paper uses boldfaced n as perturbation which is quite confusing (since small n is the dimension). I would suggest to replace it by something else, e.g, \\Delta. \n\n- Section 2.3 seems redundant. It's clearly that L1 regularization is better given it's the dual norm of Linf, so clearly it's better than L2 norm. You have proved L2 is not good anyway in experiments. \n\n===========\n\nAfter seeing the rebuttal, my concerns about the parameters have been well addressed. Also, I agree with the authors that there are use cases for post quantization, and personally I think post quantization is much easier to do in practice than quantization-aware training. However, this is quite subjective so the fact that the proposed method doesn't outperform quantization-aware training is still a weakness of the paper. \n\nI would like to slightly raise the score to borderline/weak-accept. I hope the authors can have some experiments on non-uniform quantization if the paper is being accepted; I really think that will demonstrate the strength of the method. People will likely to use this method if it can consistently improve many different kinds of post quantization.
