Specifically, they use two agents \u2014 a setter agent that sets goals, and a solver agent that solves the goals provided by the setter.  While this has been explored before, the difficulty lies in training both agents simultaneously in a robust fashion. If the goals are too difficult, the solver will be unable to solve them and if they are too easy, the solver will be unable to improve. The authors propose a combination of different losses to help the setter balance its goal predictions \u2014 validity, feasibility and coverage. In addition, they train a judge model predict the reward that the solver agent would achieve on a goal proposed by the setter. Empirical results on two setups demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in learning a good curriculum. \n\nPros:\n1. Clear writing, method is easy to understand. \n2. Novel objectives for a multi-agent training setup\n\nCons:\n1. Empirical results do not contain any baselines or prior work comparisons (only ablations of the proposed model)\n\n\u2014\u2014\nUpdates:\nThanks to the authors for their response. I realize I was not very clear in my comment above. I wanted to point out that the authors could consider adding other (simpler) baselines such as Sukhbaatar et al. (2017) to make their empirical results more complete for the navigation tasks (even though these methods make certain assumptions, it would be interesting to see how much of an effect they have compared to the proposed method). If you are able to, I\u2019m convinced the paper will be much stronger. Nevertheless, I think this is very interesting work!", "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_derivations_and_theory": "N/A"}
