The qualitative results are very impressive. Unfortunately, the paper is very poorly written. If the authors can address the issues below and improve the quality of the writing, I would recommend that this paper be accepted. However, in its current state, I recommend that this paper be rejected.\n\nMajor:\nThe claim that \u201cThis is the first unsupervised model that can identify objects in a 3D scene\u201d is not true. There is MONet and Iodine that can identify objects without supervision in 2D projections of 3D scenes. This claim should be revised.\n\nWhat is r_C in p(z|c, r_C)?\n\nThe authors are using non-standard GQN notation and their notion is not consistent. The authors should make their notation consistent or use the standard GQN notation. Section two would not make sense to people that are not already familiar with GQN.\n\nThe scene volume map is interesting, the inductive bias preventing two objects being present in the same location is interesting, however one could imagine a case where uncertainty in the model could lead to two objects being represented in the same cell.\n\nThe terms in Equation 3 should be explained more explicitly. The way I understand it p(s_n|z, x) is the view-point dependent representations of the objects and this is why you condition on z, x. Placing p(s_n|z, x) in the text where you talk about s_n being view dependant with some explanation would help.\n\nWhy do you use a Gaussian distribution for the position? Would it not make more sense to use a uniform distribution? Could this be related to bias in your data? I.e. more objects in the centre of the scene?\n\nWhat happens if object n is not present in the context image, y_c? In this case what is s_{c,n}^pos. Also, this notation: r_n = f({y_c,n}c)  is a little ambiguous. I assume it means that you are applying the function f to the set of all patches in y_c? Also, what is the object invariant object encoder? A reference to details in the appendix or a footnote would suffice.\n\nIt\u2019s great that you are able to exploit the coordinate transform and use it for rendering.\n\nThe results are very impressive: being able to swap in and out objects in a scene, showing the 2D renderings of single objects from different view-points and the scene decompositions and predicting where the \u201cmissing\u201d object is (Figure 6).\n\nMinor:\nThe introduction could be strengthened with additional references. There are claims that object-wise factorisation will help with transfer, it would be good to have references to other work that supports this view. Also the claim that humans have 3D representations for objects requires a reference.\n\nTypos (there are too many to list here, these are just a few):\n* Abstract: and and rendering\n* \u201cand\u201ds should be replaced with commas in the second line of the intro.\n* Generally the paper is not written well.\n* The GQN, as a conditional \u2192 is a conditional\n* Target observations (in section 2) does not need a capital.\n* This sentence does not make sense: \u201cinstead of encoding compressing the whole scene\u201d\n* Because of intractable posterior\n\nThere are many additional grammatical errors. \n\n\n-----------\nEdit: Following changes made to the paper, I am now more satisfied. The writing should still be improved further and suggest that the authors fully revise the paper before the camera ready version, if the paper is accepted. I have increased my score to 6.", "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_derivations_and_theory": "I assessed the sensibility of the derivations and theory."}
